## Create a palette preview image by using a simple config file

# Usage:
1. `pip install prev_gen`  
2. Open up [the example](https://github.com/Aonodensetsu/prev_gen/blob/main/example.py) to see how everything works (instructions in the file)
3. Create a file based on instructions (or just edit the example)
4. Run that file to start the app

You can also import the package and use it in any of your code, simply pass an appropriate palette to the Preview class and you will get a pillow Image back. Simple as can be!

# Example:
Inspired by the great [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme, where even the preview is impressive  
And so, below is the Gruvbox palette preview recreated with this app
